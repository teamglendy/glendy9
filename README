this is a improved version of games/glendy, also known as trap the cat game.

game "engine" can be found in engine.c,
it handles stuff related to game logic, and leaves client details to clients.
clients must implment routines for interacting with user (taking input, showing the map).

two clients currently are included, plan 9 client and cli client.
new features:
	- ablity to play as glenda
	- multiplayer (local and networked)
	- better colors!
	- cli and sdl clients
	- game server

game logic is seprated from client details and interface,
and can be found on engine.[ch], there are also some portablity code
in unix.c for plan 9 systems.

cli.c and gui9.c contain clients, there is also a server in srv.c
neither of clients currently support networked multiplayer mode, so srv.c is unused currently :)

there are some documention of engine details in doc.
